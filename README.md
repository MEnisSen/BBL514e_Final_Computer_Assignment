Generate a data set, D1, composed of two classes of linearly separable data points, each of which comprising 100 data points per class. Now generate another data set, D2, this time composed of two classes of linearly non-separable data points, each of which comprising 100 data points per class. Randomly pick 10 vectors from each class for each data set and allocate them as the test sets, T1, and T2.

  1. Plot the data points in D1 and in D2 as separate scatter plots. (5 points)

  2. Implement the hard-margin SVM and obtain the results for D1. Report also your test set results on T1. (10 points)  

  3. Implement the soft-margin SVM and obtain the results for D2. Report also your test set results on T2. (10 points)

  4. Implement a two-layer multi-layer-perceptron (MLP) structure and use it to classify the data points in D1 and D2. Compare your SVM results and MLP results and comment. (15 points)
